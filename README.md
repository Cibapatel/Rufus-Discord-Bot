# THIS BRANCH IS MAINTAINED AT A SLOWER PACE AND THE BETTER BRANCH CAN BE FOUND ON THE OTHER BRANCH OF THIS REPOSITORY (COMMANDO VERSION)

Rufus is a dicord bot with the intention of replacing MEE6. The intention is to make bots open sourced and so that more people build bots using Discords extensive API.

The extensive guide to building a Javascript bot can be found [here](https://www.discordjs.guide).

This is no way affliated to the company Rufus.

**THE COMMANDO VERSION OF THIS CODE IS IN [THIS](https://github.com/anjannair/Rufus-Discord-Bot/tree/commando) BRANCH**
